    <h3>SKINNER'S LIFE OF MONK.</h3>

    <p>Reading for a different purpose in the domestic papers of
    Charles II.'s reign in the State Paper Office, I came upon a
    letter from Thomas Skinner, dated Colchester, Jan. 30. 1677, of
    which I will give you what I have preserved in my notes; and
    that is all that is of any interest.</p>

    <p>It is a letter to the Secretary of State, asking for
    employment, and recommending himself by what he had done for
    Monk's memory. He had previously written some account of Monk,
    and he describes an interview with Lord Bath (the Sir John
    Grenville of the Restoration); in which his Lordship expressed
    his approval of the book.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"He [Lord Bath] professed himself so well satisfied,
        that he was pleased to tell me there were two persons, viz.
        the King and the Duke of Albemarle, that would find some
        reason to reflect upon me."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Lord Bath gives Skinner a letter to the Duke of Albemarle
    (Monk's son), who receives him very kindly, and gives him a
    handsome present.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I have since waited on his Grace again, and then he
        proposed to me (whether upon his own inclination or the
        suggestion of some about him) to use my poor talent in
        writing his father's life apart in the universal language;
        to which end, he would furnish me with all his papers that
        belonged to his late father and his secretaries. The like
        favour it pleased my Lord of Bath to offer me from his own
        papers, some whereof I had a sight of in his study."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Now if any of your readers who are interested in Monk's
    biography, will refer to the author's and editor's prefaces of
    <i>Skinner's Life of Monk</i>, edited in 1723, by the Rev.
    William Webster; and to Lord Wharncliffe's introduction to his
    Translation of M. Guizot's <i>Essay on Monk</i>, they will see
    the use of this letter of Skinner's.</p>

    <p>1. The life is ascribed to Skinner only on circumstantial
    evidence, which is certainly strong, but to which this letter
    of Skinner's is a very important edition. This letter is indeed
    direct proof, and the first we have, of Skinner's having been
    employed on a life of Monk, in which he had access to his son's
    and his relative Lord Bath's papers; and there can be no
    serious doubt that the life edited by Mr. Webster was a result
    of his labours.</p>

    <p>2. This letter would show that Skinner was not on intimate
    terms with Monk, nor so closely connected with him as would be
    implied in Mr. Webster's and Morant's, the historian of
    Colchester, description of him, that he was a physician to
    Monk. Else he would not have required Lord Bath's letter of
    introduction to the son. Lord Wharncliffe has, I have no doubt,
    hit the mark, when he says that Skinner was probably Monk's
    Colchester apothecary. Skinner says himself, in his preface,
    that "he had the honour to know Monk only in the last years of
    his life."</p>

    <p>3. The previous account of Monk, which gained Lord Bath's
    approval, and led to Monk's son soliciting him to write a life,
    is probably Skinner's addition of a third part to Bate's
    <i>Elenchus Motuum</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"
       id="page378"></a>{378}</span> to which he also probably
       refers in the opening of his Preface to the <i>Life of
       Monk</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I have heretofore published something of a like nature
        with the following sheets, though in another language,
        wherein several things, through want of better information,
        were imperfectly described."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>4. It appears from Skinner's letter, that his original
    intention was to write a Life in Latin. Webster edited the Life
    which we have, from a copy in English found in the study of Mr.
    Owen, late curate at Bocking in Essex, and supposed to be in
    Skinner's handwriting; and he had seen another copy, agreeing
    literally with the former, which had been transcribed by
    Shelton, formerly rector of St. James's in Colchester; and
    which, after Mr. Shelton's death, became the property of Mr.
    Great, an apothecary in Colchester. (Webster published in
    1723.)</p>

    <p>Now, Query, as these may have been copies of a translation,
    can any Colchester reader help to settle affirmatively or
    negatively the question of a Latin <i>Life of Monk</i> by
    Skinner?</p>

    <p>I add two other Queries:&mdash;</p>

    <p>It appears from a passage in the <i>Life</i> (p. 333.), that
    Skinner appended, or intended to append, a collection of
    papers:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"As appears from His Majesty's royal grant or warrant to
        him (Sir John Grenville), which we have transcribed from
        the original, and have added in the collection at the end
        of this history."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Webster says he never could get any account of this
    collection of papers. Can Colchester now produce any
    information about them?</p>

    <p>Can any of your readers give any information about those
    papers of the second Duke of Albemarle, and of Grenville, Earl
    of Bath, to which Skinner had access? Lord Bath's papers were
    probably afterwards in the hands of his nephew Lord Lansdowne,
    who vindicated Monk in answer to Burnet.</p>

    <h3>CUNNINGHAM'S LIVES OF EMINENT ENGLISHMEN.&mdash;WHITGIFT
    AND CARTWRIGHT.</h3>

    <p>In a modern publication, entitled <i>Lives of Eminent
    Englishmen</i>, edited by G.G. Cunningham, 8 vols. 8vo.
    Glasgow, 1840, we meet with a memoir of Archbishop Whitgift,
    which contains the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"While Whitgift was footing to an archbishopric, poor
        Cartwright was consigned to poverty and exile; and at
        length died in obscurity and wretchedness. How pleasant
        would it have been to say that none of his sufferings were
        inflicted by his great antagonist, but that he was treated
        by him with a generous magnanimity! Instead of this,
        Whitgift followed him through life with inflexible
        animosity."&mdash;<i>Cunningham's Lives</i>, ii. 212.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mr. Cunningham gives no authority for these statements; but
    I will furnish him with my authorities for the contradiction of
    them.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"After some years (writes Walton, in his <i>Life of
        Hooker</i>), the Doctor [Whitgift] being preferred to the
        see, first of Worcester and then of Canterbury, Mr.
        Cartwright, after his share of trouble and imprisonment
        (for setting up new presbyteries in divers places against
        the established order), having received from the Archbishop
        many personal favours, retired himself to a more private
        living, which was at Warwick, where he became master of an
        hospital, and lived quietly and grew rich;... the
        Archbishop surviving him but one year, <i>each ending his
        days in perfect charity with the other</i>."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To the same effect is the statement in Strype, which I
    borrow from Dr. Zouch's second edition of <i>Walton's
    Lives</i>, p. 217.:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Thomas Cartwright, the Archbishop's old antagonist, was
        alive in 1601, and grew rich at his hospital at Warwick,
        preaching at the chapel there, saith my author, very
        temperately, according to the promise made by him to the
        Archbishop; which mildness of his some ascribed to his old
        age and more experience. But the latter end of next year he
        deceased. And now, at the end of Cartwright's life, to take
        our leave of him with a fairer character, it is remarkable
        what a noble and learned man, Sir H. Yelverton, writes of
        some of his last words&mdash;'<i>that he seriously lamented
        the unnecessary troubles he had caused in the Church, by
        the schism he had been the great fomenter of, and wished to
        begin his life again, that he might testify to the world
        the dislike he had of his former ways</i>;' and in this
        opinion he died."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I find it stated, moreover, on the authority of Sir G.
    Paul's <i>Life of Whitgift</i>, that Cartwright acknowledged
    the generosity of Whitgift, and admitted "his bond of duty to
    the Archbishop to be so much the straiter, as it was without
    any desert of his own."&mdash;<i>Carwithen's History of the
    Church of England</i>, i. 527. 2nd edit.</p>

    <p>Lest this should not suffice to convict Mr. Cunningham of
    error, I will adduce two extracts from <i>The Life of Master
    Thomas Cartwright</i>, written by the Presbyterian Sa. Clarke,
    in 1651, and appended to his <i>Martyrologie</i>.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"About the same time [viz. 1580], the Earl of Leicester
        preferred him [Cartwright] to be master of his hospital at
        Warwick, which place was worth to him about one hundred
        pounds."&mdash;Clarke, p. 370.</p>

        <p>"For riches, he sought them not; yea, he rejected many
        opportunities whereby he might have enriched himself. His
        usual manner was, when he had good sums of gold sent him,
        to take only one piece, lest he should seem to slight his
        friend's kindness, and to send back the rest with a
        thankful acknowledgement of their love and his acceptance
        of it; <i>professing that, for that condition wherein God
        had set him, he was as well furnished as they for their
        high and great places</i>."&mdash;Ib. p. 372.</p>

    <h3>INEDITED LETTER OF THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH.</h3>

    <p>Several notices of the Duke of Monmouth having appeared in
    "NOTES AND QUERIES," you may be glad to have the following
    letter, which I copied <i>literatim</i> some years ago in the
    State Paper Office from the domestic papers of the year 1672.
    The letter was written to Lord Arlington, then Secretary of
    State. Monmouth was at the time commanding the English force
    serving under Louis XIV. against the Dutch, and was in his
    twenty-third year. Mr. Ross had been his tutor; and was at this
    time, I believe, employed in the Secretary of State's
    office.</p>

    <h3>LYDGATE AND COVERDALE, AND THEIR BIOGRAPHERS.</h3>

    <p>Dan John Lydgate, as Warton truly observes, was not only the
    poet of his monastery, but of the world in general. Yet how has
    he been treated by his biographers? Ritson, in his
    <i>Bibliographia Poetica</i>, says, "he died at an advanced
    age, after 1446." Thomson, in his <i>Chronicles of London
    Bridge</i>, 2nd edition, p. 11., says, "Lydgate died in the
    year 1440, at the age of sixty;" and again, at p. 164. of the
    same work, he says, "Lydgate was born about 1375, and died
    about 1461!" Pitt says that he died in 1482; and the author of
    the <i>Suffolk Garland</i>, p. 247., prolongs his life
    (evidently by a typographical blunder), to about the year 1641!
    From these conflicting statements, it is evident that the true
    dates of Lydgate's birth and decease are unknown. Mr.
    Halliwell, in the preface to his <i>Selection from the Minor
    Poems</i> of John Lydgate, arrives at the conclusion from the
    MSS. which remain of his writings, that he died before the
    accession of Edward IV., and there appears to be every adjunct
    of external probability; but surely, if our record offices were
    carefully examined, some light might be thrown upon the life of
    this industrious monk. I am not inclined to rest satisfied with
    the dictum of the Birch MS., No. 4245. fo. 60., that no
    memorials of him exist in those repositories.</p>

    <p>The only authenticated circumstances in Lydgate's biography
    (excepting a few dates to poems), are the following:&mdash;He
    was ordained subdeacon, 1389; deacon, 1393; and priest, 1397.
    In 1423 he left the Benedictine Abbey of Bury, in Suffolk, to
    which he was attached, and was elected prior of Hatfield
    Brodhook; but the following year had license to return to his
    monastery again. These dates are derived from the Register of
    Abbott Cratfield, preserved among the Cotton MSS. Tiber, B.
    ix.</p>

    <p>My object in calling the attention of your readers to the
    state of Lydgate's biography is, to draw forth new facts.
    Information of a novel kind may be in their hands without
    appreciation as to its importance.</p>

    <p>I take this opportunity of noticing the different dates
    given of Myles Coverdale's death.</p>

    <p>Strype says he died 20th May, 1565, (<i>Annals of
    Reformation</i>, vol. i. pt. ii. p. 43., Oxf. ed.), although
    elsewhere he speaks of his as being alive in 1566. Neale
    (<i>Hist of Pur.</i>, vol. i. p. 185.) says, the 20th May,
    1567. Fuller (<i>Church Hist.</i>, p. 65. ed. 1655) says he
    died on the 20th of January, 1568, and "Anno 1588," in his
    <i>Worthies of England</i>, p. 198., ed. 1662.</p>

    <p>The following extract from "The Register of Burials in the
    Parish Church of St. Bartholomew's by the Exchange" sets the
    matter at rest. "Miles Coverdall, doctor of divinity, was
    buried anno 1568., the 19th of February."</p>

    <p>That the person thus mentioned in the register is Miles
    Coverdale, Bishop of Exeter, there can be no doubt, since the
    epitaph inscribed on the tomb-stone, copied in <i>Stow's
    Survey</i>, clearly states him to be so. It is, perhaps,
    unnecessary to observe that the date mentioned in the extract
    is the old style, and, therefore, according to our present
    computation, he was buried the 19th of February, 1569.</p>

    <p>Can any of your correspondents throw any light upon the
    authorship of a work frequently attributed to Myles Coverdale,
    and thus entitled, "A Brieff discours off the Troubles begonne
    at Frankford in Germany, Anno Domini, 1554. Abowte the Booke
    off common prayer and Ceremonies, and continued by the Englishe
    Men theyre, to the ende off Q. Maries Raigne, in the which
    discours, the gentle reader shall see the verry originall and
    beginninge off all the contention that hathe byn, and what was
    the cause off the same?" A text from "Marc 4." with the date
    MDLXXV. Some copies are said to have the initials "M.C." on the
    title-page, and the name in full, "Myles Coverdale," at the end
    of the preface; but no notice is taken of this impression in
    the excellent introductory remarks prefixed by Mr. Petheram to
    the reprint of 1846. If the valuable work was really
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page380"
       id="page380"></a>{380}</span> written by Myles Coverdale
       (and it is much in his style), it must have been
       interspersed with remarks by another party, for in the
       preface, signed, as it is said by Coverdale, allusion is
       made to things occuring in 1573, four years after his
       death.</p>

    <h2>QUERIES.</h2>

    <h3>SPECULUM EXEMPLORUM:&mdash;EPISTOLA DE MISERIA
    CURATORUM.</h3>

    <p>Who was the compiler of the <i>Speculum Exemplorum</i>,
    printed for the first time at Deventer, in 1481? A copy of the
    fourth edition, Argent, 1490, does not afford any information
    about this matter; and I think that Panzer (v. 195.) will be
    consulted in vain. Agreeing in opinion with your correspondent
    "GASTROS" (No. 21. p. 338.) that a querist should invariably
    give an idea of the extent of his acquaintance with the subject
    proposed, I think it right to say, that I have examined the
    list of authors of <i>Exempla</i>, which is to be found in the
    appendix to Possevin's <i>Apparatus Sacer</i>, tom. i. sig.
    &beta; 2., and that I have read Ribadeneira's notice of the
    improvements made in this <i>Speculum</i> by the Jesuit Joannes
    Major.</p>

    <p>Who was the writer of the <i>Epistola de Miseria
    Curatorum?</i> My copy consists of eight leaves, and a large
    bird's-cage on the verse of the last leaf is evidently the
    printer's device. Seemiller makes mention of an Augsburg
    edition of this curious tract. (<i>Biblioth. Acad. Ingolstad.

    <h3>THE SECOND DUKE OF ORMONDE.</h3>

    <p>The review of Mr. Wright's <i>England under the House of
    Hanover, illustrated by the Caricatures and Satires of the
    Day</i>, given in the <i>Athenæum</i> (No. 1090.), cites a
    popular ballad on the flight and attainder of the second Duke
    of Ormonde, as taken down from the mouth of an Isle of Wight
    fishmonger. This review elicited from a correspondent
    (<i>Athenæum</i>, No. 1092.) another version of the same ballad
    as prevalent in Northumberland. I made a note of these at the
    time; and was lately much interested at receiving from an
    esteemed correspondent (the Rev. P. Moore, Rochenon, co.
    Kilkenny), a fragment of another version of the same ballad,
    which he (being at the time ignorant of the existence of any
    other version of the song) had taken down from the lips of a
    very old man of the neighbourhood, viz.:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"My name is Ormond; have you not heard of me?</p>

            <p>For I have lately forsaken my own counterie;</p>

            <p>I fought for my life, and they plundered my
            estate,</p>

            <p>For being so loyal to Queen Anne the great.</p>

            <p>Queen Anne's darling, and cavalier's delight,</p>

            <p>And the Presbyterian crew, they shall never have
            their flight.</p>

            <p>I am afraid of my calendry; my monasteries are all
            sold,</p>

            <p>And my subjects are bartered for the sake of English
            gold.</p>
            <hr class="short" />
            <hr class="short" />

            <p>But, as I am Ormond, I vow and declare,</p>

            <p>I'll curb the heartless Whigs of their wigs, never
            fear."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I do not quote the versions given in the <i>Athenæum</i>,
    but, on a comparison, it will be seen that they all must have
    been derived from the same original.</p>

    <p>The success of your queries concerning the Duke of Monmouth
    impel me to propose a few concerning the almost as unfortunate,
    and nearly as celebrated, second Duke of Ormonde. Many scraps
    of traditionary lore relative to the latter nobleman must
    linger in and about London, where he was the idol of the
    populace, as well as the leader of what we should now call the
    "legitimist" party.</p>

    <p>With your leave. I shall therefore propose the following
    Queries, viz.:&mdash;</p>

    <p>1. Who was the author of the anonymous life of the second
    Duke of Ormonde, published in one volume octavo, some years
    after his attainder?</p>

    <p>2. Was the ballad, of which the above is a fragment, printed
    at the time; and if so, does it exist?</p>

    <p>3. What pamphlets, ballads, or fugitive pieces, were issued
    from the press, or privately printed, on the occasion of the
    Duke's flight and subsequent attainder?</p>

    <p>4. Does any contemporary writer mention facts or incidents
    relative to the matter in question, between the period of the
    accession of George I., and the Duke's final departure from his
    residence at Richmond?</p>

    <p>5. Does any traditionary or unpublished information on the
    subject exist in or about London or Richmond.</p>

    <h3>MAYORS.&mdash;WHAT IS THEIR CORRECT PREFIX?</h3>

    <p>I wish to ask, of any of your numerous readers, what may be
    considered the most proper official prefix for Mayors, whether
    Right Worshipful or Worshipful? Opinions, I find, differ upon
    the subject. In the <i>Secretary's Guide</i>, 5th ed. p. 95. it
    is said that Mayors are Right Worshipful; the late Mr. Beltz,
    <i>Lancaster Herald</i>, was of opinion that they were
    Worshipful only; and Mr. Dod, the author of a work on
    Precedence, &amp;c., in answer to an inquiry on the point,
    thought that Mayors of <i>cities</i> were Right Worshipful, and
    those of <i>towns</i> were only Worshipful. With due deference,
    however, I am rather inclined to think that all Mayors, whether
    of cities, or of towns, ought properly to be styled "the
    <i>Right</i> Worshipful" for the following reason:&mdash;all
    Magistrates are Worshipful, I believe, although not always in
    these days so designated, and a mayor being the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"
       id="page381"></a>{381}</span> chief magistrate ought to have
       the distinctive "<i>Right</i>" appended to his style. And
       this view of the subject derives some support from the fact
       of a difference being made with regard to the Aldermen of
       London (who are all of them magistrates), those who have
       passed the chair being distinguished as the Right
       Worshipful, whilst those below the chair are styled the
       worshipful only; thus showing that the circumstance of being
       Mayor is considered worthy of an especial distinction.
       Probably it may be said that custom is the proper guide in a
       case like this, but I believe that there is no particular
       custom in some towns, both prefixes being sometimes used,
       and more frequently none at all. It seems desirable,
       however, that some rule should be laid down, if possible, by
       common consent, that it may be understood in future what the
       appropriate Prefix is. I shall be glad if some of your
       heraldic or antiquarian readers will give their opinions,
       and if they know of any authorities, to quote them.</p>

    <h3>QUEVEDO&mdash;SPANISH BULL-FIGHTS.</h3>

    <p>The clear and satisfactory reply that "MELANION" received in
    No. 11. to his query on the contradictions in <i>Don
    Quixote</i>, tempts me to ask for some information respecting
    another standard work of Spanish literature, written by a
    cotemporary of the great Cervantes.</p>

    <p>How is it, that in the <i>Visions of Don Quevedo</i>, a work
    which passes in review every amusement and occupation of the
    Spanish people, <i>the national sport of bull-fighting</i>
    remains <i>entirely unnoticed</i>?</p>

    <p>The amusement was, I presume, in vogue during the 16th and
    17th centuries; and the assignations made, and the intrugues
    carried on, within the walls of the amphitheatre would have
    supplied many an amusing, moralising penitent, male and female,
    to the shades below&mdash;the "fabulæ manes" with whom Quevedo
    held converse. As my copy of the <i>Visions</i> is an anonymous
    translation, and evidently far from being a first-rate one, I
    shall not be surprised if I receive as an
    answer,&mdash;"<i>Mistaken as to your fact, read a better
    translation</i>:" but as in spite of its manifold, glaring
    defects, I have no reason to suspect that the text is
    <i>garbled</i>, I think I may venture to send the query.</p>

    <p>In "Vision 7." I find Nero accusing Seneca of having had the
    insolence to use the words, "I and my king." I have often heard
    of Henry VIII., Wolsey, and "Ego et rex meus;" but as I never
    heard Quevedo quoted as an illustration, I look upon this as
    one of the suspicious passages in my copy of his work.</p>

    <h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

    <p><i>Gilbert Browne</i>.&mdash;"G.C.B." is desirous of
    information respecting the family from which was descended
    Gilbert Browne of the Inner Temple, who died about a century
    ago, and was buried in North Mymms Church, Herts, where there
    is a monument to him (vide Clutterbuck's <i>History</i>); also
    as to the arms, crest, and motto, as borne by him, and whether
    he was in any way related to Michael Browne of Hampton Court,
    Herefordshire, who married Elizabeth Philippa, daughter of Lord
    Coningsby, as stated in Collins's <i>Peerage</i>. He also
    desires information as to any enrolment of arms previous to the
    Visitations, by which the bearings of families who had grants
    of land from the Conqueror may be ascertained; as, for
    instance, a family who began to decay about the end of the 14th
    century, having previously been of great rank and position.</p>

    <p><i>The Badger</i>.&mdash;Can any body point out to me any
    allusion, earlier than that in Sir T. Browne's <i>Vulgar
    Errors</i>, to the popular idea that the legs of the badger
    were shorter on one side than on the other, whence Mr. Macaulay
    says, "I think that Titus Oates was as uneven as a badger?"</p>

    <p><i>Sir William Coventry</i>.&mdash;Pepys mentions in his
    <i>Diary</i>, that Sir William Conventry kept a journal of
    public events. Is anything known of this journal? It is not
    known of at Longleat, where are several papers of Sir William
    Conventry's.</p>

    <p>A MS. letter from Lord Weymouth to Sir Robert Southwell,
    giving an account of Sir W. Conventry's death, was sold at the
    sale of Lord de Clifford's papers in 1834. Can any of your

    <p class="author">C.</p>

    <p><i>Shrew</i>.&mdash;Is <i>shrew</i>, as applied to the
    shrew-mouse, and as applied to a scolding woman, the same word?
    If so, what is its derivation?</p>

    <p>The following derivations of the word are cited by Mr. Bell.
    <i>Saxon</i>, "Schreadan," to cut; "Schrif," to censure;
    "Scheorfian," to bite; "Schyrvan," to beguile. <i>German</i>,
    "Schreiven," to clamour; none of which, it is obvious, come
    very near to "Schreava," the undoubted Saxon origin of the word
    shrew.</p>

    <p>Now it was a custom amongst our forefathers to endeavour to
    provide a remedy against the baneful influence of the
    shrew-mouse by plugging the wretched animal alive in a hole
    made in the body of an ash tree, any branch of which was
    thenceforth held to be possessed of a power to cure the disease
    caused by the mouse. It thereupon occurred to me that just as
    <i>brock</i>, a still existing name for the badger, is clearly
    from the Saxon <i>broc</i>, persecution,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"
       id="page382"></a>{382}</span> in allusion to the custom of
       baiting the animal; so <i>schreava</i> might be from
       <i>schræf</i>, a hollow, in allusion to the hole in the ash
       tree; and on that supposition I considered "shrew," as
       applied to a woman, to be a different word, perhaps from the
       German <i>schreyen</i>, to clamour. I have, however, found
       mentioned in Bailey's Dictionary a Teutonic word, which may
       reconcile both senses of "shrew,"&mdash;I mean
       <i>beschreyen</i>, to bewitch. I shall be obliged to any of
       your subscribers who will enlighten me upon the subject.</p>

    <p>"<i>As lazy as Ludlum's dog, as laid him down to

    South Yorkshire (Sheffield especially) as to be frequently
    quoted by the first half, the other being mentally supplied by
    the hearer. There must, of course, be some legend of Ludlum and
    his dog, or they must have been a pair of well-known
    characters, to give piquancy to the phrase. Will any of your

    <p><i>Anecdote of a Peal of Bells</i>.&mdash;There is a story,
    that a person had long been absent from the land of his
    nativity, where in early life, he had assisted in setting up a
    singularly fine peal of bells. On his return home, after a
    lapse of many years, he had to be rowed over some water, when
    it happened that the bells struck out in peal; the sound of
    which so affected him, that he fell back in the boat and died!

    <p><i>Sir Robert Long.</i>&mdash;"ROSH." inquires the date of
    the death of <i>Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Long</i>, who founded,
    in 1760, a Free School at Burnt-Yates, in the Parish of Ripley,
    co. Yorks., and is said to have died in Wigmore Street, London,
    it is supposed some years after that period.</p>

    <p><i>Dr. Whichcot and Lord Shaftesbury.</i>&mdash;It is stated
    in Mr. Martyn's <i>Life of the First Lord Shaftesbury</i>, that
    Dr. Whichcot was one of Shaftesbury's most constant companions,
    and preached most of his sermons before him; and that the third
    Earl of Shaftesbury, the author of the Characteristics, is said
    to have published a volume of Whichcot's sermons from a
    manuscript copy of the first Lord Shaftesbury's wife. Can any
    of your readers give any further information as to the intimacy
    between Whichcot and Shaftesbury, of which no mention is made
    in any memoir of Whichcot that I have seen?</p>

    <p>were written by Henry Viscount Palmerston, on the death of

    <p>They also have been attributed to Dr. Hawkeworth, but his

    window of Romsey Church, containing some lines to the memory of
    Lady Palmerston, but they are not the same. Perhaps some of
    your correspondents are competent to discover the truth.</p>

    establishment which settled in England about the time of the
    Conquest; and one of which, the subject of my query, formed a
    colony at Ecclesfield, near Sheffield?</p>

    <p>I feel an interest in this little colony, because my early
    predecessors in this vicarage were elected from its monks.
    Moreover, some remains of their convent, now incorporated into
    what is called "the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page383"

    <p><i>Queries as to "Lines on London Dissenting Ministers" of a
    former Day</i>.&mdash;Not having made <i>Notes</i> of the
    verses so entitled, I beg to submit the following
    <i>Queries</i>:&mdash;</p>

    <p>1. Does there exist any printed or manuscript copy of lines
    of the above description, in the course of which Pope's "Modest
    Foster" is thus introduced and apostrophised:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"But see the accomplish'd orator appear,</p>

            <p>Refined in judgment, and in language clear:</p>

            <p>Thou only, Foster, hast the pleasing art</p>

            <p>At once to charm the ear and mend the heart!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Other conspicuous portraits are those of THOMAS BRADBURY,
    ISAAC WATTS, and SAMUEL CHANDLER. The date of the composition
    must be placed between 1704 and 1748, but I have to solicit
    information as to who was its author.</p>

    <p>2. Has there been preserved, in print or manuscript, verses
    which circulated from about 1782-1784, on the same body of men,
    as characterised, severally, by productions of the vegetable
    world, and, in particular, by <i>flowers</i>? The
    <i>bouquet</i> is curious, nor ill-selected and arranged. One
    individual, for example, finds his emblem in a
    <i>sweet-briar</i>; another, in a <i>hollyhock</i>; and a
    third, in a <i>tulip</i>. RICHARD WINTER, JAMES JOUYCE, HUGH
    WASHINGTON, are parts of the fragrant, yet somewhat thorny and
    flaunting nosegay. These intimations of it may perhaps aid
    recollection, and lead to the wished-for disclosure. It came
    from the hand, and seemed to indicate at least the theological
    partialities of the lady<a id="footnotetag1"

    there will be less difficulty in answering another
    entomological question&mdash;Why do the country-people in the

    "earwig" itself is sufficiently puzzling, but "coach-bell"
    seems, if possible, still more utterly unintelligible.</p>

    applied to the money collected at Eton Montem for the Captain
    of the Colleges? Towards investigating the subject, I can only
    get as far as <i>Salt</i> Hill, near Slough, where there was a
    mount, on which, if I remember rightly, the Captain waved a
    flag on Montem day. A brief account of the origin of Montem
    would be interesting; and it is especially worth noting now
    that the pageant is suppressed.</p>

    <p><i>Ludlow's Memoirs.</i>&mdash;"C." is anxious to learn if
    the manuscript of Ludlow's Memoirs is known to exist, or to
    receive any information as to where it might probably be
    found.</p>

    <p>Ludlow died at Vevay, in Switzerland, in 1693, and the
    Memoirs were published at Vevay shortly after.</p>

    <p>There is no will of Ludlow's in Doctor's Commons.</p>

    <p><i>Finkle or Finkel.</i>&mdash;I should be glad if any of
    your numerous correspondents could give me the derivation and
    meaning of the word <i>Finkle</i>, or <i>Finkel</i>, as applied
    to the name of a street. There is a street so designated in
    Carlisle, York, Richmond in Yorkshire, Kendal, Sedberg, Norwich
    (in 1508 spelt Fenkyl, and in 1702 Fenkel), and, I believe, in
    many other of our more ancient cities and towns. In the
    township of Gildersome, a village some few miles from Leeds,
    there is an ancient way, till lately wholly unbuilt upon,
    called Finkle Lane; and in London we have the parish of St.
    Benedict Finck, though I do not imagine that the latter is any
    way synonymous with the word in question. The appellation of
    Finkle is, without doubt, a descriptive one; but the character
    of the lane so styled in Gildersome seems to negative the idea
    that it has any reference to the peculiarity of trade or class
    of persons carried on or inhabiting the locality distinguished
    by this title.</p>

    <p><i>Coxcombs vanquish Berkeley, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In Lewis's

    <p class="author">R.F. Johnson.</p>

    <p><i>Derivation of Sterling.</i>&mdash;What is the derivation
    of <i>Sterling</i>? Some authors say from "Easterling," a race
    of German or Dutch traders; but is it not more likely from
    "steer," a bull, or ox, viz. a coin originally stamped with a
    figure of that animal? Of this, and parallel cases, we have
    many instances among the ancients. I find also, that, in a
    decree issued in the time of Richard I., the word is used, and
    explained by "peny" as a synonym. Now peny or penny is clearly
    from <i>pecunia</i>, and that from <i>pecus</i>, so that we
    have the two words brought side by side, one through the Latin,
    and the other through the Saxon language.</p>

    <h2>REPLIES.</h2>

    <h3>BLUNDER IN MALONE'S SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

    <p>I regret that no further notice has been taken of the very
    curious matter suggested by "Mr. Jebb" (No 14. p. 213.), one of
    the many forgeries of which Shakspeare has been the object,
    which ought to be cleared up, but which I have neither leisure
    nor materials to attempt; but I can afford a hint or two for
    other inquirers.</p>

    <p>1. This strange intermixture of some <i>John</i>
    Shakspeare's confession of the Romish faith with <i>William</i>
    Shakspeare's will, is, as Mr. Jebb states to be found in the
    <i>Dublin</i> edition of Malone's <i>Shakspeare</i>, 1794, v.
    i. p. 154. It is generally supposed that this Dublin edition is
    a copy (I believe a piracy) of the London one of 1790; but by
    what means the <i>three</i> introductory paragraphs of John
    Shakspeare's popish confession were foisted into the real will
    of William is a complete mystery.</p>

    <p>2. Malone, in a subsequent part of his prolegomena to both
    of those editions (Lond. v. i. part II. 162., and Dublin, v.
    ii. p. 139.), printed a pretended will or confession of the
    faith of <i>John</i> Shakspeare, found in a strange, incredible
    way, and evidently a forgery. This consisted of fourteen
    articles, of which the first <i>three</i> were missing. Now the
    <i>three</i> paragraphs foisted into <i>William's</i> will
    would be the kind of paragraphs that would complete
    <i>John's</i> confession; but they are not in confession. Who,
    then, forged <i>them</i>? and foisted
    <i>them</i>&mdash;<i>which Malone had never seen</i>&mdash;into
    so prominent a place in the Dublin reprint of Malone's
    work?</p>

    <p>3. Malone, in his inquiry into the <i>Ireland</i> forgeries,
    alludes to this confession of faith, admits that he was
    mistaken about it, and intimates that he had been imposed on,
    which he evidently was; but he does not seem to know any thing
    of the second forgery of the three introductory paragraphs, or
    of their bold introduction into William Shakspeare's will in
    the Dublin edition of his own work.</p>

    <p>It is therefore clear that Mr. Jebb is mistaken in thinking
    that it was "a blunder of <i>Malone's</i>." It seems, as far as
    we can see, to have been, not a blunder, but an audacious
    fabrication; and how it came into the Irish edition, seems to
    me incomprehensible. The printer of the Dublin edition, Exshaw,
    was a respectable man, an alderman and a Protestant, and
    <i>he</i> could have no design to make William Shakspeare pass
    for a papist; nor indeed does the author of the fraud, whoever
    he was, attempt <i>that</i>; for the three paragraphs profess
    to be the confession of <i>John</i>. So that, on the whole, the
    matter is to me quite inexplicable; it is certain that it must
    have been a premeditated forgery and fraud, but by whom or for
    what possible purpose, I cannot conceive.</p>

    <h3>HINTS TO INTENDING EDITORS.</h3>

    <p><i>Beaumont and Fletcher; Gray; Seward; Milton.</i>&mdash;By
    way of carrying out the suggestion which you thought fit to
    print at page 316, as to the advantages likely to arise from
    intimations in your pages of the existence of the MS.
    annotations, and other materials suitable to the purposes of
    intending editors of standard works, I beg to mention the
    following books in my possession, which are much at the service
    of any editor who may apply to you for my address,
    viz.:&mdash;</p>

    <p>1. A copy of Tonson's 10 vol. edit. of Beaumont and Fletcher
    (8vo. 1750), interleaved and copiously annotated, to the extent
    of about half the plays, by Dr. Hoadly.</p>

    <p>2. Mr. Haslewood's collection of materials for an edit. of
    Gray, consisting of several works and parts of works, MS.
    notes, newspaper cuttings, &amp;c., bound in 6 vols.</p>

    <p>3. A collection of works of Miss Anne Seward, Mr. Park's
    copy, with his MS. notes, newspaper cuttings, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>As a first instalment of my promised notes on Milton's
    <i>Minor Poems</i>, I have transcribed the following from my
    two copies, premising that "G." stands for the name of Mr.
    Gilchrist, and "D." for that of Mr. Dunster, whose name is
    misprinted in your 316th page, as "Duns<i>ton</i>."</p>

    <h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

    <p><i>Depinges</i> (No. 18. p. 277., and No. 20. p.
    326.).&mdash;I have received the following information upon
    this subject from Yarmouth. Herring nets are usually made in
    four parts or widths,&mdash;one width, when they are in actual
    use, being fastened above another. The whole is shot overboard
    in very great lengths, and forms, as it were, a wall in the
    sea, by which the boat rides as by an anchor. These widths are
    technically called "<i>lints</i>" (Sax. lind?); the uppermost
    of them (connected by short ropes with a row of corks) being
    also called the "<i>hoddy</i>" (Sax. hod?), and the lowest, for
    an obvious reason, the "<i>deepying</i>" or "<i>depynges</i>,"
    and sometimes "<i>angles</i>."</p>

    <p>At other parts of the coast than Yarmouth, it seems that the
    uppermost width of net bears exclusively the name of
    <i>hoddy</i>, the second width being called the first
    <i>lint</i>, the third width the second lint, and the fourth
    the third lint, or, as before, "depynges."</p>

    <p class="author">W.R.F.</p>

    <p><i>Lærig</i>.&mdash;Without contraverting Mr. Singer's
    learned and interesting paper on this word (No. 19. p. 292.), I
    hope I shall not be thought presumptuous in remarking that
    there must have been some other root in the Teutonic language
    for the two following nouns, leer (Dutch) and lear (Flemish),
    which both signify leather (lorum, Lat.), and their diminutives
    or derivatives leer-ig and lear-ig, both used in the sense of
    <i>tough</i>.</p>

    <p>Supposing the Ang.-Sax. "lærig" to be derived from the same
    root, it would denote in "ofer linde lærig," the leather
    covering of the shields, or their capability to resist a
    blow.</p>

    <p>I will thank you to correct two misprints in my last
    communication, p. 299.; pisan for pison, and
    '&Iota;&omicron;&alpha;&nu;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; for
    '&Iota;&omega;&alpha;&nu;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf;.</p>

    <p>By the by, the word "pison" is oddly suggestive of a
    covering for the breast (<i>pys</i>, Nor. Fr.). See <i>Foulques
    Fitzwarin</i>, &amp;c.</p>

    <p class="author">B.W.</p>

    <p><i>Lærig</i> (No. 19. p. 292.).&mdash;The able elucidation
    given by Mr. Singer of the meaning of this word, renders,
    perhaps, any futher communication on the point unnecessary.

    worthy of notice.</p>

    <i>De Danorum Rebus Gestis Poema Danicum Dialecto
    Anglo-Saxonica</i> (Havniæ, 1815), that "Lind hæbbendra" is
    rendered "Vesilla habens;" but then, on the other hand, in
    Biorn Haldorsen's <i>Islandske Lexicon</i> (Havniæ, 1814),
    "Lind" (v. ii. p. 33) is translated "Scutum tiligneum."</p>

    <p class="author">C.I.R.</p>

    <p><i>Vox et præterea nihil</i> (No. 16. p. 247.).&mdash;The
    allusion to this proverb, quoted as if from the <i>Anatomy of
    Melancholy</i>, by "C.W.G." (No. 16. p. 247.), may be found in
    Addison's <i>Spectator</i>, No. 61, where it is as

    No. 17. p. 269.).&mdash;The following etymology of "heaviers"
    will probably be considered as not satisfactory, but this
    extract will show that the term itself is in use amongst the
    Scotch deerstalkers in the neighbourhood of Loch Lomond.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Ox-deer, or 'heaviers,' as the foresters call them
        (most likely a corruption from the French 'hiver'), are
        wilder than either hart or hind. They often take post upon
        a height, that gives a look-out all round, which makes them
        very difficult to stalk. Although not so good when December
        is past, still they are in season all the winter; hence
        their French designation."&mdash;<i>Colquhoun's Rocks and

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Havior</i>.&mdash;Without offering an opinion as to the
    relative probability of the etymology of this word, offered by
    your various correspondents (No. 17. p. 269.), I think it right
    that the use of the word in Scotland should not be
    overlooked.</p>

    <p>In Jamieson's admirable <i>Dictionary</i>, the following
    varieties of spelling and meaning (all evidently of the same
    word) occur:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>Skene traces this word to the low Latin, <i>averia</i>,

    (No. 21. p. 336.) will find their opinion of the letter being
    spurious confirmed by the appendix to <i>Lord Hervey's
    Memoirs</i>, (vol. ii. p. 582.), and the editor's note, which
    proves the inaccuracy of the circumstances on which the
    inventor of the letter founded his fabrication. In addition to
    Lord Braybrooke's proofs that Sir Robert was not disabled by
    the stone, for some days previous to the 24th, from waiting on
    the king, let me add also, from Horace Walpole's authority, two
    conclusive facts; the first is, that it was not till <i>Sunday
    night</i>, the 31st <i>January</i> (<i>a week after</i> the
    date of the letter) that Sir Robert made up his mind to resign;
    and, secondly, that he had at least two personal interviews
    with the king on that subject.</p>

    passage:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>

        the English Saxon War; and all the countries lying north or

        Northan-Humbra-ric] that is, the Kingdome of

    <p><i>Gray's Elegy</i>.&mdash;In reply to the Query of your
    correspondent "J.F.M." (No. 7. p. 101.), as well as in allusion
    to remarks made by others among your readers in the following
    numbers on the subject of Gray's <i>Elegy</i>, I beg to state
    that, in addition to the versions in foreign languages of this
    fine composition therein enumerated, there is one printed among
    the poem, original and translated, by C.A. Wheelwright, B.A. of
    Trinity College, Cambridge, published by Longman &amp; Co.
    1811. (2d. edition, 1812.) If I mistake not, the three
    beautiful stanzas, given by Mason in his notes to Gray, viz.
    those beginning,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The thoughtless world to majesty may bow,"</p>

            <p>"Hark! how the sacred calm that breathes
            around,"</p>

            <p>"Him have we seen," &amp;c.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>(the last of which is so remarkable for its Doric
    simplicity, as well as being essential to mark the concluding
    period of the contemplative man's day) have not been admitted
    into any edition of the <i>Elegy</i>.</p>

    <p>With the regard to the last stanza of the epitaph, its
    meaning is certainly involved in some degree of obscurity,
    though it is, I think, hardly to be charged with irreverence,
    according to the opinion of your correspondent "S.W." (No. 10.
    p. 150.). By the words <i>trembling hope</i>, there can be no
    doubt, that Petrarch's similar expression, <i>paventosa
    speme</i>, quoted in Mason's note, was embodied by the English
    poet. In the omitted version, mentioned in the beginning of
    this notice, the epitaph is rendered into Alcaics. The
    concluding stanza is as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Cromwell's Estates</i> (No. 18. p. 277., and No. 21. p.
    339.).&mdash;I am much obliged to "SELEUCUS" for his answer to
    this inquiry, as far as regards the seignory of Gower. It also
    throws a strong light on the remaining names; by the aid of
    which, looking in Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire, I have
    identified <i>Margore</i> with the parish of Magor (St.
    Mary's), hundred of Caldecott, co. Monmouth: and guess, that
    for Chepstall we must read <i>Chepstow</i>, which is in the
    same hundred, and the population of which we know was stout in
    the royal cause, as tenants of the Marquis of Worcester would
    be.</p>

    <p>Then I guess Woolaston may be <i>Woolston</i> (hundred of
    Dewhurst), co. Gloucester; and Chaulton, one of the
    <i>Charltons</i> in the same county, perhaps <i>Charlton
    Kings</i>, near Cheltenham; where again we read, that many of
    the residents were slain in the civil war, <i>fighting on the
    king's side</i>.</p>

    <p>This leaves only Sydenham without something like a probable
    conjecture, at least: unless here, too, we may guess it was
    miswritten for Siddington, near Cirencester. The names, it is
    to be observed, are only recorded by Noble; whose inaccuracy as
    a transcriber has been shown abundantly by Carlyle. The record
    to which he refers as extant in the House of Commons papers, is
    not to be found, I am told.</p>

    <p>Now, if it could be ascertained, either that the name in
    question had been Cromwell's, or even that they were a part of
    the Worcester estates, before the civil war, we should have the
    whole list cleared,&mdash;thanks to the aid so effectually
    given by "SELEUCUS'S" apposite explanations of one of its
    items.</p>

    <p><i>Franz von Sickingen</i>.&mdash;Your correspondent
    "S.W.S." (No. 21. p. 336.) speaks of his having had some
    difficulty in finding a portrait of Franz Von Sickingen; it may
    not therefore, by uninteresting to him to know (if not already
    aware of it) that upon the north side of the nave of the
    cathedral of Treves, is a monument of Richard Von
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page390"

       Treves against the said Franz; and upon the entablature are
       portraits of the said archbishop on the one side, and his
       enemy Franz on the other. Why placed there it is difficult
       to conceive, unless to show that death had made the prelate
       and the robber equals.</p>

    correspondent "A MAN IN A GARRET" (No. 19. p. 308.) is not
    warranted in stating that M. de Gournay was the author of the
    above axiom of political economy. Last session Lord J. Russell
    related an anecdote in the House of Commons which referred the
    phrase to an earlier date. In the <i>Times</i> of the 2nd of
    April, 1849, his Lordship is reported to have said, on the
    preceding day, in a debate on the Rate-in-Aid Bill, that
    Colbert, with the intention of fostering the manufactures of
    France, established regulations which limited the webs woven in
    looms to a particular size. He also prohibited the introduction
    of foreign manufactures into France. The French vine-growers,
    finding that under this system they could no longer exchange
    their wine for foreign goods, began to grumble. "It was then,"
    said his Lordship, "that Colbert, having asked a merchant what
    he should do, he (the merchant), with great justice and great
    sagacity, said, 'Laissez faire et laissez passer'&mdash;do not
    interfere as to the size and mode of your manufactures, do not
    interfere with the entrance of foreign imports, but let them
    compete with your own manufactures."</p>

    <p>Colbert died twenty-nine years before M. de Gournay was
    born. Lord J. Russell omitted to state whether Colbert followed
    the merchant's advice.</p>

    <p><i>College Salting and Tucking of Freshmen</i> (No. 17. p.
    261., No. 19. p. 306.).&mdash;A circumstantial account of the
    tucking of freshmen, as practised in Exeter College, oxford, in
    1636, is given in Mr. Martyn's <i>Life of the First Lord
    Shaftesbury</i>, vol. i. p. 42.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"On a particular day, the senior under-graduates, in the
        evening, called the freshmen to the fire, and made them
        hold out their chins; whilst one of the seniors, with the
        nail of his thumb (which was left long for that purpose),
        grated off all the skin from the lip to the chin, and then
        obliged him to drink a beer-glass of water and salt."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Lord Shaftesbury was a freshman at Exeter in 1636; and the
    story told by his biographer is, that he organised a resistance
    among his fellow freshmen to the practice, and that a row took
    place in the college hall, which led to the interference of the
    master, Dr. Prideaux, and to the abolition of the practice in
    Exeter College. The custom is there said to have been of great
    antiquity in the college.</p>

    <p>The authority cited by Mr. Martyn for the story is a Mr.
    Stringer, who was a confidential friend of Lord Shaftesbury's,
    and made collections for a Life of him; and it probably comes
    from Lord Shaftesbury himself.</p>

    <p><i>Byron and Tacitus</i>.&mdash;Although Byron is, by our

    indulge myself in reading his works by stealth. Among the

    reprint of <i>The Pardonere and Frere</i>, he would confer a
    favour which would be duly appreciated by the possessors of
    that rare tract, small as their number must be; since, in my

    than twenty copies printed."</p>

    <p><i>Mistake in Gibbon</i> (No. 21. p. 341.).&mdash;The
    passage in Gibbon has an error more interesting than the mere
    mistake of the author. That a senator should make a motion to
    be repeated and chanted by the rest, would be rather a strange
    thing; but the tumultuous acclamations chanted by the senators
    as parodies of those in praise of Commodus, which had been
    usual at the Theatres (Dio), were one thing; the vote or decree
    itself, which follows, is another.</p>

    <p>There are many errors, no doubt, to be found in Gibbon. I
    will mention one which may be entertaining, though I dare say
    Mr. Milman has <span class="pagenum"><a name="page391"
       id="page391"></a>{391}</span> found it out. In chap. 47.
       (and <i>see</i> note 26.), Gibbon was too happy to make the
       most of the murder of the female philosopher Hypatia, by a
       Christian mob at Alexandria. But the account which he gives
       is more shocking than the fact. He seems not to have been
       familiar enough with Greek to recollect that
       '&alpha;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&nu; means
       <i>killed</i>. Her throat was cut with an oyster-shell,
       because, for a reason which he has very acutely pointed out,
       oyster-shells were at hand; but she was clearly not "cut in
       pieces," nor, "her flesh scraped off the bones," till after
       she was dead. Indeed, there was no scraping from the bones
       at all. That they used oyster-shells is a proof that the act
       was not premeditated. Neither did she deserve the title of
       modest which Gibbon gives her. Her way of rejecting suitors
       is disgusting enough in Suidas.</p>

    <p><i>Public Libraries</i>.&mdash;In looking through the

    have escaped my notice, any mention of a valuable one in
    <i>Newcastle-on-Tyne</i>, "Dr. Thomlinson's;" for which a
    handsome building was erected early last century, near St.
    Nicholas Church, and a Catalogue of its contents has been
    published. I saw also, some years ago, a library attached to
    <i>Wimborne Minster</i>, which appeared to contained some
    curious books.</p>

    <p>The Garrison Library at <i>Gibraltar</i> is, I believe, one

    <p>Mr. Wykeham Archer's <i>Vestiges of Old London</i>, of which
    the Second Part is now before us, maintains its character as an
    interesting record of localities fast disappearing. The
    contents of the present number are, the "House of Sir Paul
    Pindar, in Bishopgate Without," once the residence of that
    merchant prince, and now a public-house bearing his name;
    "Remains of the East Gate, Bermondsey Abbey;" which is followed
    by a handsome staircase, one of the few vestiges still
    remaining of "Southhampton House," the residence of the
    Wriothesleys, Earls of Southampton. A plate of "Street
    Monuments, Signs, Badges, &amp;c.," gives at once variety to
    the subjects, and a curious illustration of what was once one
    of the marked features of the metropolis. "Interior of a Tower
    belonging to the wall of London," in the premises of Mr. Burt,
    in the Old Bailey, presents us with a curious memorial of
    ancient London in its fortified state; it being the only
    vestige of a tower belonging to the wall in its entire height,
    and with its original roof existing. The last plate exhibits
    some "Old Houses, with the open part of Fleet Ditch, near Field
    Lane;" and the letter-press illustration of this plate
    describes a state of filth and profligacy which we hope will
    soon only be known among us as a thing that <i>has

    <h3>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>

    <p>W.R.F. and T.P. are assured that the omissions of which they
    complain have arisen neither from want of courtesy nor want of
    attention, as they would be quite satisfied if they knew all
    the circumstances of their respective cases.</p>

    <p>NOTES AND QUERIES may be procured by the Trade at noon on
    Friday; so that our country Subscribers ought to experience no
    difficulty in receiving it regularly. Many of the country
    Booksellers are probably not yet aware of this arrangement,
    which enables them to receive Copies in their Saturday parcels.
    Part V. is now ready.</p>

    <p>ERRATUM. By a provoking accident, some few copies of the
    last No. were worked off before the words "Saxoniæ," "Saxonia"
    and "audactes," in p. 365. col. 2. were corrected to
    "Saxoni<i>ce</i>" and "audacte<i>r</i>."</p>

    <p>THE CHURCHES OF THE MIDDLE AGES. By HENRY BOWMAN and JOSEPH
    S. CROWTHER, Architects, Manchester. To be completed in Twenty
    Parts, each containing Six Plates, Imperial folio. Issued at
    intervals of two months. Price per Part to Subscribers, Proof,
    large paper, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; Tinted, small paper,
    9<i>s.</i>; plain, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Parts 1 to 7 are now
    published, and contain illustrations of Ewerby Church,
    Lincolnshire; Temple Balsall Chapel, Warwickshire; and
    Heckington Church, Lincolnshire.</p>

    <p>On the 1st of July next, the price of the work, to
    Subscribers, whose names may be received after that date, will
    be raised as follows:&mdash;Proofs, tinted, large paper, per
    Part 12<i>s.</i>; tinted, small paper, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
    Plain, 9<i>s.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Ewerby is a magnificent specimen of a Flowing
        Middle-Pointed Church. It is most perfectly measured and
        described: one can follow the most recondite beauties of
        the construction, mouldings and joints, in these Plates,
        almost as well as in the original structure. Such a
        monograph as this will be of incalculable value to the
        architects of our Colonies or the United States, who have
        no means of access to ancient churches. The Plates are on
        stone, done with remarkable skill and distinctness. Of
        Heckington we can only say that the perspective view from
        the south-east presents a very vision of beauty; we can
        hardly conceive anything more perfect. We heartily
        recommend this series to all who are able to patronize
        it."&mdash;<i>Ecclesiologist</i>, Oct. 1849.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"This, if completed in a similar manner to the Parts now
        out, will be a beautiful and valuable work. The perspective
        of St. Andrew's, Heckington, is a charming specimen of
        lithography, by Hankin. We unhesitatingly recommend Messrs.
        Bowman and Crowther's work to our readers, as likely to be
        useful to them."&mdash;<i>Builder</i>, Sept. 29. 1849.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The fourth and fifth parts of Messrs. Bowman and
        Crowther's 'Churches of the Middle Ages' are published, and
        fully support our very favourable impression of the work.
        As a text-book, this work will be found of the greatest
        value."&mdash;<i>Builder</i>, Jan. 19. 1850.</p>

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
